## About
The following is a tutorial on how to develop intuition about **normal distributions** by the means of interacting with graphs,
which can be used as an effective teaching means.

<ul>
  <li> The 3D plot is not saved here on the notebook. </li>
  <li> Need to have jupyter-widgets installed and enabled on jupyter notebook / jupyter lab. </li>
</ul>
